# Machine-Learning-Model-Car-Price-Prediction

The objective of this project is to develop accurate car price prediction models using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing the provided dataset and applying various techniques, including gradient boosting, random forest, and linear regression, the goal is to create models that can effectively estimate car prices based on relevant features. The assignment focuses on exploring different algorithms, evaluating their performance, and selecting the most accurate model for predicting car prices. The ultimate aim is to enhance the understanding and application of machine learning in the context of car price prediction.

## Following steps will be followed to reach our goal:

- Importing Required Libraries: The necessary libraries and packages are imported to facilitate data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

- Reading the Concerned Dataset: The dataset related to car prices is loaded into the program for further analysis and modeling.

- Data Understanding: Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the dataset, including the features, their types, and the target variable (car prices).

- Data Handling: Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.

- Data Visualization: Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are created to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the data.

- Data Transformation: If necessary, data transformation techniques such as feature scaling or encoding categorical variables are applied to prepare the data for modeling.

- Splitting the Data and Feature Scaling: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. Feature scaling may be applied to ensure all features are on a similar scale.

- Building a Model: Machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest regression, or gradient boosting regression are constructed to predict car prices based on the available features.

- Conclusion: The project concludes by evaluating and comparing the model's performance using appropriate metrics, providing insights into the effectiveness of the chosen model and potential areas of improvement.
